                TED stands for "technology, entertainment and design" and upholds its values and motives on these three pillars. What started as a conference in 1984 soon became the epicentre of ideas, innovation, and knowledge- a forum for the dissemination of the thoughts of the greatest thinkers!<br>
                TED’s slogan, “Ideas worth Spreading” shows the ingenuity and erudition that every TED event possesses and the important role these thoughts play in the life of every individual on the face of this planet.<br>
                TED is an idea in itself, it strongly believes that every thought has the capability to change the world and therefore TED initiatives such as TED fellow Program, TED Conference, TED Talks, and TEDx Program provide us the platform to turn an impetus thought into an insightful idea- a trajectory which leads us into a better horizon.

                With its motto of “ideas worth spreading,” TED has created a programme called TEDx, where x represents an ‘independently organized TED event.’ A TEDx event is a locally driven and non- profit-oriented event where live TED-like talks and performances are shared with the community, which are organized by like-minded local volunteers or organizations concerned with making positive and effective changes for society, helping the local community reach the TED platform.

                It is rightly said,
                "Our greatest glory is not ever failing, but rising every time we fall.” Every community has its heroes-people constantly yearning to create, explore, and imagine new ideas, and those who dare to fail greatly but rise up even stronger. TEDxShivajiCollege aims to bring these people together to share their stories of success and feed the curiosity of young minds thereby promoting the global endeavour of TED by organizing "independent" events.TEDxShivajiCollege acts as a local community that encompasses and encourages ideas that are powerful, novel, and worth spreading and therefore aims to bring people together.

                    Shivaji College is a premier institution in West Delhi, accredited with grade 'A' by NAAC. It was ranked as one of the top 10 science colleges of the country in a survey conducted by India Today in 2017.
                    Shivaji College functions under the trusteeship of the Government of Delhi. In spite of being located in the thriving part of the city, Shivaji College campus is extremely verdurous. It has a maze of tall trees, lush green lawns and pruned hedges.
                    Shivaji College believes in and promotes the ideals of gender equality and community service.
                    Shivaji College has come a long way from its humble beginnings and moderate facilities to a campus equipped with impressive amenities.
