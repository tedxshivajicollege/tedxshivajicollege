        <p class="p2">With every move that she takes up, she stands out with grace. You would have met dancers of Kathak but she stands out for two very major reasons – her ability to effectively perform two different roles with ease and her mastered skill to produce and direct international collaborative works.

          Shovana formally learnt Kathak at Kathak Kendra in Delhi and was a determined student of Pandit Birju Maharaj and Kundanlal Gangani.She has been the grace of many prestigious stages all across the nation. She is the first ever Indian professional dancer who, for a long period of time, combined a full-fledged career as a senior serving civil servant in the Government of India, before retiring from her services in 2010.
          
          On the art and writing fronts, she has authored numerous books including Indian Classical Dances, Performing Arts in India: A Policy Perspective, Folk Dance Traditions of India, and many more. She has performed fusions of Kathak with international dance forms.
          
          Going through all the years of her miraculous works, the list of achievements finds no end. She has been honored with one of the highest honors, the Padma Shri Award. Truely, an ideal to look up to for many out there!</p>

      <p class="p2">Inspiration doesn’t come when someone or something is born to break the path or set fire. Inspiration comes when someone works with sheer dedication, determination, and will to conquer everything that one has ever dreamed of. We are born through the same process and have the same capabilities as infants, but what makes us all different individuals are the blueprints that we leave behind us. Therefore one must understand that people are not born great, they become great with their hard work. One such person who is a living example of this is Baljeet Kaur Bharti.

        Baljeet Kaur became the first (and only) Indian to climb five 8000 meter peaks in a single season. She also took fitness classes online during lockdown to chase her mountaineering dream. In addition, she is also a Raksha Mantri Awardee.
        
        Her father is a bus driver and there even was a point when her mother had to sell jewelry to support her expeditions. She ran a crowdfunding campaign to support her dreams and did not let anything deter her.
        
        Her first tryst with mountaineering was at 20, during an NCC camp. Since then, there has been no looking back. She has summited Mt. Annapurna I, Mt. Kanchenjunga, Mt. Everest, and Mt. Lhotse in less than a month. She is one of the first Indian women to summit the 7161 metre high Mt. Pumori. She is also the first Indian female mountaineer to climb the 8167 metre high Mt. Dhaulagiri. 
        
        For her, she is never lost in the mountains, it is where she finds herself. She truly is the 'mountain daughter'. Here's to chasing dreams and scaling new heights (literally as well as figuratively)! 
        
        We are grateful to have Baljeet Kaur Bharti onboard since her impressive records serve as an ideal source of inspiration for us to emulate and reach our own goals.</p>
